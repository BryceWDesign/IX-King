# Harmonic Beam Encoder Array

**Subsystem Category:** Communications  
**Module Name:** Harmonic Beam Encoder Array  
**IX-King Function:** Tesla-style tri-band communication system for ultra-low signature transmission using harmonic resonance, zero-latency field imprint, and bifilar coil phase-encoding.

## üîß Overview

The Harmonic Beam Encoder Array allows the IX-King satellite to transmit secure, encoded data across vast distances using real-world, buildable hardware. This system replaces traditional radiofrequency or laser modulation with Tesla-based harmonic field projection, modulating at Tesla‚Äôs 3-6-9 frequency families to ensure extremely low detectability and high coherence in delivery.

It speaks not by volume ‚Äî but by resonance.

## üîÑ Modulation Process

1. **Signal Initialization**  
   Internal PLL activates primary harmonic band (starting at 3.0 Hz).

2. **Data Embedding**  
   AD9833 encodes binary data into sinusoidal waveform overlays.

3. **Coil Resonance**  
   Bifilar coils inject modulated wave into spatial field as a harmonic vector.

4. **Beam Projection**  
   EM or laser beam acts as the "carrier", but signature is masked due to harmonic structure.

5. **Ground Decoding**  
   Compatible decoding station demodulates wave harmonics back into usable binary data.

## üìò Notes

- Built to legally safe, real-world specifications using only open-source-grade ICs and optical components.
- Communication remains non-interceptable without harmonic decoding alignment ‚Äî far more secure than encryption.
- Pairs perfectly with any compatible Tesla-beam ground station using harmonic demodulator coils.

## üõ†Ô∏è Safety & Handling

- Coils must be tuned under lab conditions before launch; adjust for space vacuum dielectric changes.
- Keep EM driver grounded to avoid unintentional plasma arc emission in atmosphere testing.
