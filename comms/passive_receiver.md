Version 1.0 — July 2025

## 📡 Overview

The **Passive Harmonic Receiver (PHR)** enables IX-King to receive encoded signals **without ever transmitting**.

This subsystem:
- Monitors field harmonics for encoded Tesla-style 3–6–9 pulse structures  
- Performs **resonance-only decoding** (no electromagnetic emissions)  
- Updates command queues from secure sources using only ambient frequency drift

This allows IX-King to remain *effectively invisible* to RF/EM sensors while still receiving critical updates.

## 🧬 Functional Capabilities

| Feature                    | Purpose                                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero Emission Monitoring   | Listens to environment without generating detectable signals       |
| Phase-Only Tuning          | Filters only for 3, 6, 9 harmonic phase codes                      |
| Pulse Drift Signature ID   | Authenticates sender based on exact waveform curvature             |
| No-Storage Command Execution| Executes command without saving any trace to disk/memory          |

Max signal acquisition radius (space environment): **±320 km**  
Power draw: **< 0.2W**  
Detection signature: **Below quantum vacuum noise floor**

## 📶 Decoding Protocol

Signals must conform to:
- 3-phase harmonic sequencing (Tesla-valid pulse)
- Encrypted CryoCore timestamp lock
- Angle-encoded drift variance of ≤ 0.003%

If any value exceeds bounds:
- Packet rejected  
- No log entry generated  
- Thermal blanking of logic core occurs (no trace left)

## 🔒 Security Layers

| Layer                     | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Harmonic Signature Check  | Confirms wave-form source via FFT-based resonance fingerprint       |
| Temporal Drift Matcher    | Syncs packet timing with CryoCore field oscillation envelope        |
| Self-Silencing Detector   | Auto-disables receiver if source pulse is anomalous or forced       |

## 📐 Hardware Implementation

| Component                      | Material / Source                     | Function                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Tesla Resonance Antenna Array | Toroidal nano-alloy spiral (non-emissive) | Captures ambient 3-6-9 harmonic bands      |
| CryoSync Field Filter         | Tesla-tuned supercooled phase gates    | Filters usable data from noise              |
| NoTrace Execution Core        | Volatile logic chamber (no retention)  | Processes command, wipes immediately        |

Structure has **no moving parts**, no motors, no fans.  
Receives by **tuning**, not by scanning.  
Processes via **in-phase field capture**, not direct logic call.

## 🚫 Detection Suppression

PHR uses:
- Zero-point resonance echo suppression  
- EM-blank housing with chiral shielding  
- Field convergence masking to match cosmic background levels

Practical result:  
> Satellite appears **thermally and electromagnetically dormant**  
> No observable signal intake — even under direct scrutiny

## ✅ Summary

The **Passive Harmonic Receiver** is how IX-King **hears whispers in a vacuum**.

No power surge.  
No signal trail.  
No chance of interception.

If you didn't design the resonance —  
**you’re not part of the conversation.**
