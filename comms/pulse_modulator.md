# Pulse Modulator & Harmonic Burst Comms — IX-King Satellite  
Version 1.0 — July 2025  
Author: Bryce Wooster

## 🎯 Objective

Enable burst-mode, **non-electromagnetic communication** using IX-King's existing Tesla harmonic field, without generating interceptable RF signatures or visible beam paths.

Comms are encoded as:
- Phase-modulated resonance pulses (not EM waves)
- Embedded harmonics aligned to the 3-6-9 core logic
- Short-duty cycles <20ms
- Localized through node structure; emitted only during sync pulses

## 📡 System Components

| Component            | Description                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| TeslaSync Coil       | 9-turn bifilar copper spiral per node      |
| Comms Capacitor Bank | 2200μF, low-ESR, pulse-grade               |
| Phase Encoder Array  | Low-power microcontroller with lookup ROM  |
| Pulse Output FETs    | Radiation-hardened N-channel, 20ns rise    |
| Burst Crystal Timer  | 12.000 MHz + divider array                 |

## 🧠 Encoding Logic

Data is transmitted as **modulated delay offsets** to the 3-6-9 pulse structure.

Example:  
- Normal 6ms sync pulse  
- Data 'A' → delay +0.6ms  
- Data 'B' → delay +1.2ms  
- Data 'C' → delay –0.3ms  
(…and so on, per symbol map stored in ROM)

Each comms burst:
- Is only 12 bits long  
- Lasts under 18ms  
- Happens once per orbit unless override is triggered  
- Appears as phase flutter, not EM wave, to non-harmonic observers

## 🕵 Stealth Behavior

This system is:
- **Undetectable by standard RF/optical intercept tools**  
- Immune to Doppler or radar sweep lock  
- Zero visible glow or spike on spectrum analyzers  
- Cannot be decoded without 3-6-9 phase baseline reference (Tesla lock-in)

---

## 🛰 Transmission Mode Triggers

IX-King will emit a harmonic burst when:
- Orbital telemetry exceeds phase drift of ±4.2ms  
- Power buffer exceeds 85% and CryoCore is stable  
- Manual override is received from Earth base via **encoded laser reflection pulse** (optional module)

---

## 🔒 Data Payload Types

Each burst can transmit:
- 2× 8-bit telemetry snapshots (status, power, sync error)  
- 1× 8-bit config token (adjust CryoCore delta, harvest mode)  
- Checksum via 3-6-9 parity matrix  
- Optional 3-bit encoded “identity” packet using Tesla triangle waveform (see below)

---

## 🔺 Tesla Triangle Identity Mode

This is an **opt-in** authentication mode where IX-King emits a triangle-pulsed sequence at:

| Step | Frequency (Hz) | Purpose                     |
|------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | 369             | ID flag trigger             |
| 2    | 1110            | Parity reference check      |
| 3    | 1776            | Symbolic (origin confirmation) |

Only detectable with pre-synced Tesla harmonic receivers tuned to King-family symmetry logic. Otherwise, remains non-decodable.

## 🔌 Energy Profile

Each pulse burst costs:
- ~12 mJ per 18ms burst  
- Supplied via CryoCore recovery capacitor bank  
- Never sourced from active node power line (prevents sync interference)

---

## 📓 Final Notes

IX-King doesn’t “transmit.”  
It **whispers through resonance**.  
Only those who know the tune — can hear it.
