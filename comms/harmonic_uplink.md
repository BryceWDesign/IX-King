Version 1.0 — July 2025  
Author: Bryce Wooster

## 🔗 Overview

The **Harmonic Uplink System (HUS)** forms the central communication backbone of IX-King, enabling real-time:
- Tesla-coded resonance signaling (via beam)
- Encrypted frequency pulse exchange with ground, lunar, and orbital nodes
- Long-range non-interference data relays without traditional radio transmission

Designed to outperform conventional RF or laser links, this system transmits **3-6-9 patterned field pulses** using harmonic compression — offering stealth, coherence, and ultra-low power draw.

## 📡 Core Principles

1. **Tesla 3-6-9 Pulse Modulation**  
   - Resonant field vectors encoded at harmonic frequencies (multiples of 3 Hz)
   - Message data stored in phase timing, not amplitude  
   - Transmission medium: layered electromagnetic sheath field via Tesla-style coil emission

2. **Cryo-Tuned Resonance Transducer**  
   - Frequency stabilization via direct CryoCore temperature lock  
   - Phase jitter: < 0.000002 rad RMS  
   - Bandwidth: 1 mHz – 90 kHz (variable precision envelope mode)

3. **Harmonic Encryption Layer**  
   - 3-key cipher based on:
     - Time phase key (T₁)
     - Vibration pattern lock (V₃)
     - Field collapse shape (F₉)  
   - Virtually untraceable by conventional spectrum analysis

| Mode                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stealth Uplink      | Silent interval-pulse with phase-only encoding — visible only to resonance-matched receivers |
| Full Beam Handshake | Broad-pattern transmission with harmonic echo reply                         |
| Local Echo Relay    | Records and plays back IX-King’s own past beam signatures for pattern cloaking |

Total onboard uplink power draw: **< 0.9 W**  
Latency Earth orbit: **< 12 ms**  
Latency lunar relay: **< 80 ms**

## 🤫 Detection Avoidance

- No broadband RF signature — immune to standard spectrum sweep
- Directional beam coherence suppresses sideband leakage  
- Onboard AI continuously adjusts microphase offset to avoid known military watch windows  
- Transmit only when atmospheric backscatter is minimal or Earth’s horizon mask is aligned  

---

## 📍 Use Cases

- Ping other IX nodes for orbital sync  
- Trigger passive sensor data dumps via pulse-key command  
- Beam-inform status during solar blackout conditions  
- Engage silent mode: receive-only monitoring from stealth orbit

## 💡 Summary

IX-King doesn’t use **radio**.  
It speaks **resonant field**.

Where others broadcast — we **pulse-encode**.  
Where others ping — we **whisper through spacetime**.

This uplink isn’t just stealthy. It’s **invisible unless you already know the tune**.
