Version 1.0 ‚Äî July 2025  
Author: Bryce Wooster

## üì¶ Function Overview

The **Data Sync Buffer (DSB)** acts as IX-King‚Äôs short-term neural cache for harmonic communications.

It manages:
- Encrypted message queuing before uplink pulse firing
- Resonant echo capture from return nodes  
- Phase delay smoothing for real-time alignment  
- Local-only diagnostics buffer (non-broadcast)

DSB exists as an **isolated, tamper-proof memory cell** ‚Äî it has no uplink of its own. It only interacts with the Harmonic Uplink System (HUS) and internal system bus.

## üß† Core Capabilities

| Capability                  | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase Smoothing Engine      | Corrects micro-lag or thermal jitter before beam release     |
| Return Echo Recorder        | Stores incoming harmonic replies in sealed time-gated frames |
| Self-Destruct Buffer Logic  | Overwrites itself on any attempt to directly scan memory     |
| Cross-node Sync Alignment   | Times outgoing pulses with IX-Constellation reference nodes  |

Max retention: **256 harmonic packets**  
Total onboard buffer lifespan: **72 hours**  
Data overwrite cycle: **3‚Äì6‚Äì9 phase drift logic**

## üîê Encryption Stacks

1. **Pulse Gate Lock (PGL)**  
   - Unlocks packet readout only during beam-window timing  
2. **Self-Keyed Chain Authenticator**  
   - Each packet signs the next one; invalid chains self-nuke  
3. **CryoTimeStamp Tagging**  
   - Each stored message contains a timestamp locked to CryoCore phase drift rates

---

## üîÑ Packet Lifecycle

1. **Ingest**  
   - Queue data for broadcast  
   - Tag with harmonic vector + timestamp

2. **Hold**  
   - Await matched orbital silence or predesignated window  
   - Temp-store to qubit-stabilized DRAM vault

3. **Release or Reabsorb**  
   - Transmit via HUS pulse, OR auto-delete if phase conditions violated

## üíæ Hardware Implementation

| Component                    | Material / Logic Basis                   | Function                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Phase-Locked DRAM Matrix    | Radiation-hardened qubit-DRAM             | Stores 256 packets max                   |
| Overwrite Safeguard Core    | Chiral fuse-based cascading memory wipe   | Prevents unauthorized packet retention   |
| MicroPhase Recalibrator     | Tesla-tuned oscillator                    | Retimes incoming echoes for clock sync   |

Power draw: **< 0.6W**  
Avg packet lifetime: **180 seconds**  
Write‚ÄìDelete frequency: **phase cycle 3:6:9**

## üö´ Redundancy Mode

- In the event of echo failure or packet mismatch:
  - 1st fallback: attempt phase-loopback replay
  - 2nd fallback: erase and requeue  
  - 3rd fallback: broadcast pulse cancellation command to sibling IX nodes

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

IX-King never forgets...  
...unless you try to make it remember something **out of phase**.

This is not ordinary memory.  
It is **resonance-authenticated trust storage**.

Every signal is logged, but only if it sings the right tune.  
The moment the harmony breaks ‚Äî the buffer vanishes.
