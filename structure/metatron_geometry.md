# IX-King Structural Architecture — Metatron’s Cube Frame

This document outlines the exact structural form of the IX-King satellite: a 13-node **Metatron’s Cube** lattice. This is not symbolic — it is **functionally designed** to create harmonic stability, multi-angle redundancy, and minimized radar/optical signature.

---

## 🔷 Primary Geometry

**Metatron’s Cube** integrates:
- 1 central node (CryoCore and MCU)  
- 6 nodes surrounding the central axis (orbital plane aligned)  
- 6 extended corner nodes forming tetrahedral resonance junctions  

Each node is connected by rigid truss lines using **carbon fiber struts** or **aluminum hex rods**. All dimensions scale proportionally based on desired total volume — default target is a **1.2m edge-length deployment**.

## 🧩 Node Assignments

| Node Number | Location           | Function                                  |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0           | Central            | CryoCore + harmonic timing logic          |
| 1–6         | Midplane ring      | Power harvesting (TeslaScythe arrays)     |
| 7–12        | Outer corners      | Field tuning, EM redirection, sensor housing |

Each node mounts via **3D truss interlocks** (no hinge mechanisms). Deployment occurs via **single-pulse magnetic bloom** or **spring snap lattice** from compact stowed cube. No motors required.

## 🔩 Materials

| Component              | Material                           | Justification                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Node spheres           | Carbon fiber shell + aluminum core | Lightweight, rigid, EMI resistant        |
| Connecting struts      | Aluminum hex rod or CF tube (1cm)  | Fabricatable, thermal stable             |
| Internal mounting beds | Ceramic-insulated polycarbonate    | Non-conductive thermal dampener          |
| Exterior coating       | Graphene oxide spray or BN coating | IR damping, radar scatter                |

## 📐 Structural Specs

- **Mass (dry frame)**: ~9.4 kg  
- **Max span (fully deployed)**: 1.2 meters  
- **Collapse-to-deploy ratio**: 1:6  
- **Fastener types**: M3 titanium socket heads, counterbored  
- **Thermal delta handling**: ±200°C (CryoCore sync required at edge delta >120°C)

---

## 🧲 Deployment Profile

IX-King can launch in **fully collapsed cubic shell mode** (16"x16"x16") via rideshare. Upon orbital trigger:

- Internal spring/EM bracing activates
- Frame expands outward in <1.5s
- Nodes engage locking trusses
- Harmonic sync initiates once deployed

No motors. No thrust required. Pure mechanical + EM deployment logic.

---

## 🛠 Assembly Constraints

- Recommend vacuum-safe adhesives (Loctite 9460 or equivalent)  
- All materials must be **non-outgassing** per ASTM E595 standard  
- Frame must be assembled in cleanroom class 1000 or better  
- Balance test required at 3-axis gimbal (±0.3g deviation allowed)

---

## 🧠 Field Alignment

Each face of the Metatron Cube is aligned to maintain:

- 3–6–9 phase harmonic propagation across opposite nodes  
- Toroidal field symmetry for CryoCore regulation  
- EM signature cancellation via geometry-folded deflection paths

This is not just a frame — it’s a **field resonance structure**. Shape = function = stealth = sync.

## 🔚 Next Steps

This structure interfaces directly with:
- `/core/cryocore_mount.md`  
- `/power/node_harvest_array.md`  
- `/field/stealth_propagation_logic.md`

Do not modify node geometry without altering harmonic sync logic or risk destabilizing pulse phase alignment.
