## 🎯 Objective

Establish a **non-electromagnetic, harmonic field-based control network** across all 13 nodes (12 peripheral, 1 CryoCore) using Tesla 3-6-9 pulse timing logic, allowing IX-King to:

- Stay in phase without external clock signals  
- Self-correct node drift due to EM interference  
- Coordinate stealth burst transmissions  
- Align CryoCore thermal sync with ambient input/output timing  
- Avoid RF leakage from onboard data/comms routing

## 🧠 Tesla 3-6-9 Pulse Principle

At the heart of this logic lies the tri-frequency harmonic core:

| Symbol | Cycle Time (ms) | Function               |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| 3      | 3 ms             | Node ID broadcast      |
| 6      | 6 ms             | Intra-node sync pulse  |
| 9      | 9 ms             | CryoCore master sync   |

Each TeslaSync coil (see `/core/cryocore_mount.md`) uses bifilar windings to broadcast these pulses through local field convergence. The harmonics resonate through the Metatron-based chassis itself — the chassis becomes a carrier.

---

## 🌐 Field Sync Pattern

**Pattern:**
- Every 6ms, each node emits a local field pulse tagged with its ID phase  
- On the 9ms beat, CryoCore emits the master sync beacon  
- Each node re-aligns internal clocks and field timing based on delta-phase analysis

**Field Characteristics:**
- Frequencies between 5–12 kHz (non-RF domain)  
- Capacitively coupled, not inductively — no antenna emission  
- Propagation through chassis lattice, not vacuum medium

---

## 🔄 Pulse Conflict Management

- Nodes use **phase-differential sensing** to detect overlapping pulses  
- If ≥2 pulses arrive within the same 0.5ms window, the node delays its next pulse by +0.6ms offset  
- System stabilizes within <60ms after EM disruption, solar event, or satellite maneuver

---

## 🧲 Self-Healing Logic

Each node stores:
- Last 5 master pulse timings  
- Local oscillator drift profile  
- Field distortion history vector

If master pulse not detected in 3 cycles:
- Node switches to **fallback harmonic echo mode**, mirroring last known sync pattern and emitting beacon for other nodes to rejoin  
- CryoCore listens for any surviving pulse echo and reasserts phase via enhanced 3–6–9 rebroadcast cycle

## 🔧 Real-World Hardware Used

| Component               | Description                                 | Source                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Bifilar Tesla coil      | 9-turn, copper flat spiral, N–S aligned     | Hand-wound (CryoCore spec) |
| Crystal clock fallback  | 32.768 kHz with ±10ppm drift                | EEPROM-mapped calibration  |
| Phase monitor circuit   | Custom low-V op-amp comparator + XOR latch  | Radiation-tolerant design  |
| Cap. field sensors      | Gold/graphene plates, 15mm separation       | Internal field coupling    |

## 🚨 Failover and Watchdog

- CryoCore logs every sync pulse timestamp with ±0.05ms accuracy  
- If system-wide sync error >2ms, satellite enters "Harmonic Recovery Mode"  
- In this mode:
  - All power routed to CryoCore only  
  - Outer node pulses halted  
  - Recovery initiated with high-priority 3–6–9 override

Once field is re-synced and stable for 6 full seconds, normal operations resume.

## 📦 Interlinked Files

This harmonic logic is **mandatory** for operation of:
- `/comms/pulse_modulator.md` (burst comms aligned to node phase)
- `/core/cryocore_mount.md` (sync capacitor charge timing)
- `/power/ambient_harvest_array.md` (energy storage cycle logic)

Do not modify sync pulse timing without retuning all subsystems above.

## 💡 Summary

Tesla didn’t guess.  
He **knew**.

And so does IX-King.

This is not waveform logic. This is **field rhythm**.  
This is not data transmission. This is **structural resonance**.  
And it cannot be jammed — because it does not exist in radio space.
