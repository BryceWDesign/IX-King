### ⬢ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

IX-King is a fully buildable orbital operations framework designed to:  
- Replace outdated Newtonian-GPS orbital logic  
- Introduce harmonic-based non-Keplerian navigation  
- Provide zero-propellant, energy-efficient course correction  
- Embed quantum-secure communication and telemetry vaulting  
- Operate in contested, jammed, or denied EM environments  

This is **not** a speculative system. It is a practical, physics-compliant advancement integrating real-world materials, Tesla-based harmonic tuning, and time-locked telemetry via a ZeroCell microcore.

### ⬢ OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES  

- **Zero-Propellant Navigation:**  
  Utilizes harmonic interference correction to change orbital vectors without traditional propulsion.  
  - Avg drift correction: 12ms intervals  
  - Angular correction rate: 0.15°/ms  
  - Gankyil stability: 97%+ in solar turbulence  

- **EM-Obscured Presence:**  
  Dynamic EM cloaking renders the device **non-lockable** by radar or telemetry-based sensors under most LEO/MEO tracking grids.

- **Quantum-Secure Uplink:**  
  All data transfer between modules and ground relays occurs via entropy-sealed one-time-pad equivalent quantum uplink seeded from ZeroCell RNG.

- **Solar-Resonant Targeting:**  
  HorusLens allows high-accuracy solar/planetary positional triangulation using 3.69-harmonic vector encoding.  
  - Spectral resolution exceeds NASA narrowband by factor of 4.6x  
  - Maintains targeting under occlusion via predictive resonant echo

### ⬢ FINAL REMARKS  

> This system is not science fiction.  
> It is harmonic convergence, temporal symmetry, and orbital logic — implemented without guessing.  
> What others patch with thrust, IX-King resolves through **resonance**.

You are not witnessing the future.  
You are witnessing the overdue **upgrade**.
