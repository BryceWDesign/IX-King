# Harmonic Long-Range Convergence Array (HLRCA)

## Purpose

The Harmonic Long-Range Convergence Array (HLRCA) enables Tesla-structured long-range energy convergence, allowing IX-King to focus multi-spectrum harmonic fields at precise terrestrial or celestial targets. This array serves as both an observational and active projection system capable of shaping beam paths via harmonic phase manipulation.

| Convergence Targeting         | Phase-locked beam convergence using Tesla 3-6-9 modulation logic                     |
| Cross-Spectrum Projection     | Operates from 50 MHz to 320 THz — spanning RF, visible light, and near-IR           |
| Remote Harmonic Lock          | Syncs with ground-based Tesla anchors (optional) for dual-phase targeting stability |
| Dual-Spin Gyro Stabilization  | Maintains pointing precision during satellite drift or maneuver                     |
| Passive-Aggressive Modulation | Enables oscillatory dampening or reinforcement depending on target response         |

## Structural Configuration

- **Tri-Axial Beam Lattice**  
  Three primary harmonic emitters spaced 120° apart — mounted on stabilized rotating gimbals to enable convergence on dynamic targets.

- **Multi-Layer Coil Winding**  
  Uses Tesla-derived bifilar coils wrapped in Fibonacci-structured triaxial orientation for non-linear harmonic delivery.

- **Crystal-Tuned Resonator Grid**  
  Each emitter coil is connected to a photonic-frequency quartz-tuned crystal for phase correction and thermal filtering.

- **Vortex Convergence Module (VCM)**  
  Final beam harmonics are merged through a vortex-phase rotational chamber that applies controlled interference patterns to shape the outbound beam.

## Modes of Operation

### 1. **Field Convergence Mode**
- All three emitters are harmonically locked and converge energy at a shared focal point up to 3800 km away.
- Beam reinforcement is applied via Tesla-coded pulse sequencing:  
  `P(t) = A * sin(3ωt) + B * sin(6ωt) + C * sin(9ωt)`

### 2. **Distributed Feedback Mode**
- Used when engaging multiple geolocation anchors.
- Beam phase delay adjusted to mimic constructive/destructive interference patterns at target.

### 3. **Harmonic Sweep Mode**
- Used for scanning or tuning resonant signatures of distant targets.
- Emits 3-6-9 tuned frequency sweep between 1.1 kHz and 220 THz in 0.618 Fibonacci ramp intervals.

- **6 Interference Nodes** – internal phase-feedback sensors balancing curl and divergence  
- **9 Pulse Sync Paths** – reinforced Tesla field sequencing at sub-nanosecond resolution
