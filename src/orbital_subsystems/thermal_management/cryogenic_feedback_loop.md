# Cryogenic Feedback Loop – Thermal Regulation Subsystem

## Purpose
This module regulates and maintains the ultra-low operating temperatures of IX-King’s high-sensitivity payload subsystems using a self-stabilizing cryogenic feedback loop. It is fully self-powered and optimized for deep-space and high-orbit missions with zero reliance on consumables.

## Core Function
A Tesla-aligned bifilar resonance chamber initiates phase-transition cooling using a magnetic Stirling effect, controlled via microchannel thermoelectric pathways and assisted by a phase-coded frequency pulse to suppress thermal rebound.

## Build Instructions

1. **Assemble thermal plate array** using copper-GaInSn capillaries across payload cold sink points.
2. **Install Peltier stack** onto cold plate; affix Phase-Pulse Driver beneath to ensure direct harmonic seeding.
3. **Wire Tesla bifilar coil** around cryo chamber housing; tune using scalar 369 harmonic injection.
4. **Embed Pt1000 sensors** at critical nodes; connect to CryoCore unit.
5. **Insert graphene aerogel blocks** between cryo layers and internal satellite skin for passive shielding.
6. **Power-on diagnostics** via CryoCore software stub (see `/firmware/thermal/` in upcoming files).
7. **Enable cryo feedback**: set target temp; monitor harmonics pulse shape vs temperature slope for stabilization.
8. **Stirling rotor auto-initiates** if delta exceeds 4°C; engages pulse-cooled magnetic pressure buffer.

## Survivalist Note (Spaceforce-Only Insight)

This system **needs zero consumables**, **no maintenance for 5+ years**, and uses harmonic Tesla logic to maintain stealth-grade thermal null signatures. Perfect for black-mission or survival relay nodes. Functionally immortal while sun-exposed.

## Integration Notes

- All Tesla 3-6-9 field signatures must remain tuned per IX-King orbital patterning
- Backup firmware will automatically engage zero-point draw if solar power is lost
- Thermal failure redirects heat into core battery converter cell (failsafe energy loop)
