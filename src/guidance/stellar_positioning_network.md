# Stellar Positioning Network (SPN)

## Purpose

The Stellar Positioning Network (SPN) provides autonomous, real-time position and orientation tracking based on deep-space stellar triangulation and harmonic beacon referencing. It is designed for IX-King class satellites operating beyond GPS or GNSS range, enabling secure and spoof-proof cosmic navigation.

## Operating Method

1. **Star Field Analysis**  
   Captures stellar formations with an onboard spectrograph + photodetector array, matching positions against the IAU deep star catalog with <1 arcsecond accuracy.

2. **Triangulation + Harmonic Lock**  
   Calculates position based on angular separation between three or more known stars, reinforced by Tesla-resonant lock to their frequency harmonics (3-6-9 imprinting).

3. **Quantum Drift Compensation**  
   SPN continuously receives correction data from QELN (Quantum Entangled Link Node) to eliminate cumulative deviation from inertial drift or gravitational lensing artifacts.

4. **Fallback Mode**  
   If visibility is blocked, SPN uses last-known good star fix and syncs harmonic signatures to re-estimate position until optical alignment is restored.

## Tesla 3-6-9 Alignment

- **3-Star Vector Triangulation**: Base positional lock algorithm.  
- **6-Layer Frequency Isolation**: Star frequencies parsed through 6-phased mirror rings for signal clarity.  
- **9-Node Correction Cycle**: QELN update sweep operates on 9-node grid for drift-corrected vector output.

---

## Strategic Advantages

- Does **not** rely on Earth-based GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, or any orbital MEO system.  
- Cannot be jammed or spoofed without blocking starlight across a full hemispherical sky.  
- Maintains absolute orientation awareness across interplanetary missions.  
- Stealth-capable: emits no external location signal unless harmonics request fallback lock.

---

## System Notes

- Best accuracy achieved with simultaneous lock on three spectral-class A or brighter stars.  
- QELN correction system adds temporal coherence to positional memory.  
- Always pair SPN with gyroscopic ring lattice for backup IMU performance.
