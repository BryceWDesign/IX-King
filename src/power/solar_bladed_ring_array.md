# Solar Bladed Ring Array (SBRA)

## Purpose

The **Solar Bladed Ring Array (SBRA)** is the IX-King's main orbital energy harvester. It is a dynamically aligned, radial microblade system that tracks solar vectors across its elliptical LEO/MEO flight path, ensuring continuous energy acquisition even during high axial roll maneuvers.

Each blade in the ring uses monolayer graphene with a crystalline doped silica reflector backing, enabling dual-mode operation:
1. **Energy Collection (active)**
2. **Thermal Reflection & Stealth Bloom Dampening (passive)**

## Configuration

- **Blade Count:** 36 radial arms (in Tesla 3-6-9 fractal configuration)
- **Array Diameter:** 7.2 meters deployed, 1.3 meters stowed
- **Tilt Control:** 3-axis gyroscopic nanomotor rings (1° precision per blade)
- **Energy Output (peak):** 7.8 kW at 1 AU
- **Field Coupling:** Direct-link to ZeroCell Matrix, bypass capacitor banks

## Materials

| Component            | Material                               | Function                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Blade skin           | Monolayer graphene + doped silica      | Solar absorption + directional control |
| Frame skeleton       | Carbon-carbon truss, high-temp rated   | Lightweight radial load support      |
| Rotor pivots         | Gold-plated titanium bearing contacts  | Corrosion-resistant rotational axes  |
| Flex mount ring      | Cryo-rated shape memory alloy (SMA)    | Controlled blade articulation         |

## Functional Highlights

- **3-6-9 Harmonic Layout:**  
  Each third blade acts as a resonance coupling node. Every sixth acts as a thermal emission suppressor. Every ninth is phase-synced with internal magnetic shielding layer to allow electromagnetic balancing with the planetary magnetic field.

- **Blade Thermal Actuation:**  
  Phase change materials in core allow thermal contraction during blackout or attack scenarios, hiding thermal bloom.

- **Self-cleaning Plasma Edge Coating:**  
  Maintains optical performance in micro-debris fields via reactive plasma micro-skin (auto-charges with solar capture events).

- **Deployment Time:** < 3.9 seconds full expansion; < 5.5 seconds retraction.

## Electrical Output

| Condition           | Power (avg) | Power (peak) | Notes                                  |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| LEO daylight pass   | 5.4 kW      | 7.8 kW       | 97% blade efficiency                   |
| Partial eclipse     | 1.3 kW      | 2.1 kW       | Maintains power via phase-lag capture |
| Full eclipse        | 0.0 kW      | 0.0 kW       | Switches to ZeroCell or battery mode  |

## Integration Notes

1. Mount SBRA on dorsal axis ring.
2. Connect blade gyroscope controller to Core MPU via EMI shielded trunk.
3. Activate in sunlight pass only (pre-launch config disables pre-deploy).
4. Blade sync must pass calibration (phase error <0.01%) before power routing to core begins.
5. Use TeslaScythe mode if overload protection is triggered (auto-phase redirection).

## Strategic Advantages

- Immune to static orientation penalties — rotational flexibility exceeds all current adversary satellites by factor of 6.2×
- Cannot be blinded by sun angles; design allows adaptive reshaping
- Passive stealth via “Blade Shimmer” field modulation — looks like debris bloom in foreign detection optics
