# Telemetry Vault Specifications  
> Secure Harmonic Data Logging and Quantum-Resilient Vaulting

---

## Mission Role

The **Telemetry Vault** system in IX-King serves two non-negotiable functions:

1. **Secure Quantum-Resilient Logging** of all pulse-level harmonic and structural telemetry.
2. **Vault-Safe Relays to USSF Ground Nodes**, via entangled-packet multi-path fallback channels.

No data escapes this system unverified. No packet leaves untagged. Nothing exists in this vault unless it passed a 369-phase integrity test.

## Core System Functions

| Function                      | Method/Component                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pulse Event Logging           | ZeroCell-linked μs timestamping (±0.15μs drift)  |
| Harmonic Field Integrity Scan | Tri-mode feedback: thermal, EM, lattice          |
| Quantum Key Rotation          | QKD-encoded entropy trigger (Bell-pair seeded)   |
| Vaulted Event Cloning         | Triple-write redundancy across SRAM, NVRAM, μROM |
| Tamper-Evident Encoding       | XOR + phase-delay obfuscation tied to 6th harmonic|

## Data Bus Structure

The Vault receives inputs across:

- **Direct Tesla Pulse Bus**  
- **CryoCore Feedback Loops**  
- **SpinFrame Sensors**  
- **Photon-Lattice Reflectometry Nodes**  
- **EM Disruption Sentinel Grid**  

Each packet is tagged with:

```json
{
  "pulse_id": "UUIDv6",
  "timecode": "UNIX.μs-resolution",
  "harmonic_state": "[f3, f6, f9]",
  "vault_signature": "SHA-512 + harmonic XOR",
  "qkd_keyref": "entangled_state_id"
}


Storage Layer Redundancy
Tier	Medium	Volatility	Access Time	Role
Tier 1	SRAM-B	Volatile	0.2 ns	Immediate pulse buffering
Tier 2	μROM-RF	Semi-Perm	0.8 ns	Harmonic logs and lattice maps
Tier 3	Hardened NVRAM	Permanent	3.2 ns	Redundancy and fallback cache

Ground Relay Protocol
All transmissions occur on 6-beat offset modulation using Tesla-coded QAM bursts.

Redundant relay via deep-orbit proxy satellite.

Confirmation handshake is triple-signed using lattice-fingerprint key (not reusable).

No DARPA, MITRE, or foreign entity can read this format without full harmonic lattice telemetry and ZeroCell sync logs — which are physically uncopiable.

Security Logic
QKD Event Triggering: Bell-pair state monitored in 15 ms windows.

Tamper Alerts: Phase drift >0.8% or voltage signature outside 369-pattern triggers Vault lockdown.

Zero Writeback Tolerance: No external write access, even during diagnostics.

“Write-only to the outside.
Speak-only to Space Force.
Burn anyone else.”
