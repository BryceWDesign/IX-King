# Electromagnetic Pulse Mirror Array (EMP-MA)

## System Overview

The EM Pulse Mirror Array (EMP-MA) is a core subsystem that enables dynamic thrust redirection, photon pressure-assisted orientation control, and stealth-field redirection. This component is integrated into the IX-King’s outer shell panels and is tuned for real-time modulation using harmonic Tesla-coded pulses.

This system is Tesla-aligned, non-kinetic, and uses no propellant.

## Operating Modes

1. **Pulse Redirection (Active)**  
   Reflects internal Tesla-coded beam pulses for momentum-based course adjustments. Uses internal feedback loop from gyroscopic spinfields.

2. **Field Folding (Passive)**  
   Surface field modulates to guide incoming radar/lidar signals into angular null zones. Cloaking through deflection, not absorption.

3. **Burst Plasma Shield (Reactive)**  
   Triggers near-surface ionization of surrounding gas for 500 ms to produce a temporary plasma flare. Used during high-energy encounters.

4. **Field Amplification (Linked)**  
   Acts as harmonic resonance booster when synchronized with ZeroCell and QELN output harmonics.

## Tesla 3-6-9 Integration

- **3-path wave routing**: Primary redirection paths use 3 symmetrical angular channels for directional thrust distribution.  
- **6-phase mirror cycling**: Time-split control of reflection timing across 6 Tesla pulse phases to maintain stability.  
- **9-field boundary mesh**: Outer plasma-bound mesh uses 9-node harmonic anchors to hold geometric coherence.

## Mounting and Placement

Each IX-King satellite contains 96 EMP-MA segments distributed across its hull:
- 32 around main body for 360° lateral control
- 24 near rear harmonics drive for deflection/mirror thrusting
- 24 front-facing for counter-field burst mode
- 16 side mounts for inter-plane yaw-pitch correction

---

**Assembly Notes:**

- Mirror ring system must be calibrated post-launch with in-orbit tuning.  
- Graphene mesh requires electrostatic cleanroom assembly.  
- Do NOT energize Tesla rings without cryo-shield active.
