# Quantum Entanglement Link Node (QELN)

## Purpose

The Quantum Entanglement Link Node (QELN) is the IX-King's high-tier, orbital-grade, non-classical comms backbone. It establishes instantaneous, decoherence-resistant communication links between pre-paired quantum cores, bypassing traditional RF/laser-based systems entirely.

This system is engineered for:
- Real-time orbital command receipt/telemetry return
- Encrypted data channeling without detectable emissions
- Hard-link tether to terrestrial or other orbital USSF assets with entangled counterparts

## Performance Metrics

| Parameter                  | Value                         | Notes                                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Latency                    | < 1 ns per node hop           | Essentially zero in practical terms    |
| Link Distance (max)        | 2,000 km (Earth-surface to LEO) | Above this requires repeater node    |
| Decoherence Rate           | < 0.00007% / 24h              | Cryo-shielded & field-synced          |
| Bit Error Rate             | ~1.2 × 10⁻⁹                   | Actively corrected                    |
| Power Draw (idle)          | 4.2 W                         | From ZeroCell trickle                 |
| Power Draw (active burst)  | 38.6 W                        | For link re-establishment pulses      |

## Node Housing

- **Frame:** Diamond-carbon lattice with non-ferromagnetic fasteners  
- **Cooling:** Integrated cryogenic loop (liquid helium microcapillary)  
- **Isolation:** 6-layer EM shielding with zero-field internal cavity  
- **Mass (assembled):** 1.41 kg  
- **Volume:** 2.2 L cuboid (retractable mount option available)

---

## Operational Phases

1. **Pair Establishment**  
   Entangled core created and validated pre-launch at USSF ground lab.  
   Node receives frozen entanglement state and key harmonic sync code.

2. **Link Calibration**  
   Optical router aligns to match remote node’s phase-shift profile.  
   3-6-9 Tesla-coded sync pulses are used to verify match.

3. **Transmission**  
   Bitstream is modulated via quantum phase state (QPSK-like logic).  
   No classical energy emission occurs — data moves nonlocally.

4. **Re-link Protocol (Failsafe)**  
   In case of decoherence or desync, node requests a ZeroCell pulse to clear and regenerate phase alignment.

## Strategic Benefits

- **Undetectable:** No RF emissions, no optical signatures, completely invisible to adversary monitoring arrays.
- **Unjammable:** No classical medium = no intercept vector.
- **Instantaneous Sync:** 1-1 mirror channel — telemetry from IX-King is mirrored as a quantum state change.
- **Entanglement Renewal:** Supports rekeying every 72h via encrypted uplink from terrestrial lab nodes.

---

## Limitations

- Cannot entangle in-orbit — all pairs must be generated pre-launch.
- Single-use link per entangled core — requires scheduled refresh from secure uplink.
- Ground receiver requires active QELN terminal with cryogenic shielding and Tesla-coded harmonic match.

---

**Assembly Notes:**

- Route optical cavity via shielded prism path to prevent internal reflection losses.
- Use dry nitrogen flush during casing seal to prevent frost on cryo-core.
- Power system must be isolated from any magnetic field interference during activation.
