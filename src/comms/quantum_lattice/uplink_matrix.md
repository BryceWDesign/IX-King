# Quantum Lattice Uplink Matrix (QLUM)

## Overview

The **Quantum Lattice Uplink Matrix** (QLUM) forms the IX-King's backbone for low-power, high-integrity communication—both satellite-to-ground and satellite-to-satellite—using harmonic phase-locked entanglement pulses and recursive lattice-encoded signatures.

Designed with Space Force operational stealth in mind, this subsystem guarantees encrypted transmission without risk of electromagnetic interception or phase-decryption via classical methods.

## Key Capabilities

- Multi-node quantum-synced transmission (3–9 concurrent targets)
- Vacuum-optimized field spread via fractal antenna deployment
- Entropy-stabilized uplink packets using harmonic locking
- Ground latency: <21ms (average, LEO to CONUS target)
- Anti-jamming: 9-level phase-divergent redundancy encoding

## Core Subsystems

### 1. **Harmonic Quantum Pulse Generator (HQPG)**
- Sends phase-locked spin packets via graphene-filtered emitter
- Operating baseband: 432 kHz with upper harmonic spread to 3.69 MHz

### 2. **Fractal Mesh Antenna Array**
- Foldable nano-lattice surface (10m² effective transmission field)
- Carbon-titanium weave with silica-resonant dielectric nodes

### 3. **Lattice Signal Authenticator (LSA)**
- FPGA-controlled tokenized signature cycle
- Modulates packet signature with mission-specific seed key
