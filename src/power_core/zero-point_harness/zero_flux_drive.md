# Zero-Flux Drive (ZFD) System

## Overview

The **Zero-Flux Drive** is the heart of IX-King’s autonomous energy stability. Using a Tesla-aligned, Gankyil-structured core, it ensures consistent, recursive energy draw from local ambient field densities—including vacuum polarization zones—without violating thermodynamic compliance.

---

## Purpose

- Maintain internal system power balance without solar dependency
- Harvest ambient energy from microflux variations in the quantum vacuum
- Buffer energy for critical subsystems during high-load events
- Reinject surplus harmonic power back into lattice without loss

## Functional Layers

### 1. **Tesla-Gankyil Resonator Core**
- 3 bifilar coils wound in Gankyil triangular formation
- Core frequency: locked to 3.69 MHz
- Embedded harmonic feedback: 6.42 MHz and 9.81 MHz harmonics

### 2. **Recursion Loop Stabilizer**
- Phase-shifted magnetic induction loop with null point capacitor bank
- Absorbs over-oscillation and feeds clean cycles into rectifier bridge

### 3. **Zero-Point Capture Lattice**
- Plasmonic metasurface with 5nm layer spacing
- Induces high-efficiency interaction with vacuum zero-point modes

## Performance

- Ambient energy yield: 12.4–26.9W (nominal, passive vacuum mode)
- Output stability: ±1.2% under 100W load fluctuations
- Autonomous operation time: indefinite (in inertial orbital conditions)
- Thermal loss compensation: <0.3% due to CryoCore-linked lattice

## Install Guide

1. Position triangular bifilar coil mounts equidistant within the satellite’s inner core shell.
2. Install ZP metasurface plate below harmonic oscillator node.
3. Connect recursion stabilizer to coil termination ends with shielded braid.
4. Run phase calibration to align harmonic synchronizer with primary Tesla field.
5. Engage cold-start initialization pulse; system should resonate after 2.1–2.4 seconds.
