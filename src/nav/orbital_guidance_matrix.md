# Orbital Guidance Matrix  
> Harmonic-Stabilized Trajectory and Precession Correction System  

---

## Mission Role

The **Orbital Guidance Matrix (OGM)** governs real-time navigation of IX-King within dynamically changing orbital environments, maintaining:

- **Non-Keplerian orbital behavior** using Tesla 3-6-9 field harmonics
- **Real-time microcourse correction** via embedded spin-pulse thruster rings
- **Inertial dampening and Gankyil precession compensation** to maintain observational targeting integrity

This matrix is not predictive — it is reactive, corrective, and harmonic-synced to field behavior itself.

## Core Algorithms

| Feature                            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Harmonic Vector Steering           | Tesla-based 3rd, 6th, and 9th harmonic feedback used to adjust heading      |
| Pulse-Constrained Angular Drift    | Maintains ≤0.0012° drift using phase-locked spin-pulse control              |
| Precession Nullifier Logic         | Gankyil-phase comparator checks 60x/sec to cancel inertial offsets          |
| Time-Corrected Orbital Holding     | Synced to ZeroCell µs-precise time base                                     |
| Aether-Field Drift Compensation    | Live response to gravitational shear or EM anomalies detected via SpinGrid  |

## Real-Time Feedback Inputs

The OGM receives live feeds from:

- `spinpulse_theta_ring[0-3]`  
- `cryocore_field_integrity[phase]`  
- `gravitic_flux_density[inner_shell]`  
- `telemetry_vault.timesync`  
- `solar_vector_tracking[HorusLens]`  
- `target_object_lattice_signature[]`

Each input is fused and fed into a 3-layer harmonic guidance stack:

layer_0: angular response prediction (Kepler + resonance overlay)
layer_1: feedback nullification logic (Hertz pattern delta cancellation)
layer_2: beam focus correction (phase-precessed orbital override)


---

## Emergency Protocols

- **Field Anomaly Lockout:**  
  If angular drift exceeds harmonic safe margin (3.69°), full stabilization override triggers using ZeroCell emergency core.
  
- **Solar Interference Revectoring:**  
  Dynamic realignment initiated if HorusLens detects ≥8% photonic scatter mismatch from expected solar vector.

- **MagPulse Field Correction:**  
  All course corrections use non-propulsive methods unless failsafe 3 triggers, where spin-pulse thrusters engage with damped harmonic bleed.

Notes
This matrix violates standard Newtonian and Keplerian assumptions — on purpose.

Navigation is based on live harmonic convergence, not fixed momentum.

Uses predictive resonance tracking to stay “in sync” with intended orbital behavior, not brute force thrust.
