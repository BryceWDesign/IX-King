# Gravimagnetic Tracker System

## Overview

This subsystem captures high-resolution signatures of **field fluctuation events** and binds them to real-time gravimagnetic telemetry. It serves as a sentinel layer for the IX-King platform, enabling proactive anomaly tracking, trajectory prediction, and resonance field correction.

---

## Purpose

- Detect local spacetime curvature micro-shifts
- Identify non-visible intrusions (e.g. cloaked objects, gravitational shadows)
- Correlate harmonic anomalies with EMF and gravimagnetic deltas
- Trigger phased array counter-measures if necessary (optional mode)

---

## Operating Principles

- **Field Binding**: Tesla coil mini-nodes distributed in a triaxial lattice synchronize with ambient harmonics
- **Anomaly Tracking**: Differential shifts in μT-range field strength and spin curvature are compared to harmonic baselines
- **Tesla Harmonic Coupling**: All measurements phase-synchronized to core 3-6-9 field resonator

## Installation Procedure

1. Mount each Tesla nodal unit to its designated triaxial post within the satellite’s chassis ring.
2. Connect each vector sensor to the FPGA control matrix using shielded bus.
3. Align Heim lens cluster with main visual platform (optional but recommended).
4. Synchronize the harmonic oscillators using master pulse from 3-6-9 field core.
5. Run initial field binding sequence and calibrate baseline gravimagnetic values.
