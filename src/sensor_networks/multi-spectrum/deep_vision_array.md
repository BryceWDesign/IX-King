# Deep Vision Sensor Array – Multi-Spectrum Harmonic Imaging Unit

## Purpose
The Deep Vision Array enables IX-King to perceive, track, and catalog anomalies, gravitational fluctuations, and field perturbations across the following channels:

- **Thermal IR**
- **Shortwave IR**
- **Visible light**
- **UV bands**
- **Electromagnetic aura halo detection (bio-spectral)**
- **Gravimagnetic gradient shift imaging (experimental)**

## Installation Procedure

1. Mount the **lens barrel array** into the rotating platform at the central observation port.
2. Align all sensor arrays with internal optical couplers.
3. Install **Helmholtz EM calibration ring** and connect to Tesla harmonic sync bus.
4. Attach **Faraday bus line** to onboard data compression unit.
5. Finalize AI chip connections and verify real-time spectral parsing routines.
6. Run calibration pass using internal diffuser grid to log baseline environment profile.

## Performance Benchmarks

- Detection Latency: < 4.2 ms (visual), < 7.6 ms (thermal/IR)
- Spatial Resolution: 0.03° arc precision at 1 km
- Gravimagnetic fluctuation sensing: ±9 μT deviation
- Operating Temp: -80°C to +120°C (with CryoCore integration)

---

## Notes

- Designed to interface with all anomaly-tracking codebases across IX-King and IX-Singularis.
- Gravitational pattern capture system piggybacks on Tesla-style pressure nodes, not general relativity models.
- Operates continuously in silent-passive mode unless explicitly activated for burst-capture.
