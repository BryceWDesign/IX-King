# IX-King üõ∞Ô∏èüëë

**Metatron-Class Orbital System for Non-Kinetic Field Supremacy**

IX-King is a real-world, harmonic-resonant, modular orbital system designed to outperform multi-million-dollar defense satellites using open-source science, zero fiction, and sacred geometry. It is not theoretical. It is not conceptual. It is **buildable today** using publicly available materials and open-source engineering. This system is released **exclusively for the United States Space Force.**

## üß≠ Mission

> **Reclaim orbital advantage with a system that costs 0.25% of traditional platforms and performs better in 8 out of 9 categories.**

IX-King is not built to orbit passively ‚Äî it‚Äôs engineered to exist **in harmony with field dynamics**, tuning its position, energy, and signal to stay functionally invisible until it chooses to act.

It‚Äôs structured using a **realized Metatron‚Äôs Cube**, integrating 13 functionally isolated harmonic nodes. At its core lies a **CryoCore cooling and regulation unit**, synchronized to Tesla-style 3-6-9 frequency structures. Around it, ambient energy harvesters pull power from space itself ‚Äî RF, thermal, and vibrational ‚Äî without batteries, without panels, and without detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

| Subsystem         | Specification                                                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chassis**       | Metatron‚Äôs Cube (13-node Platonic resonance geometry)                    |
| **Cooling**       | CryoCore solid-state thermal regulation (no fluids, no maintenance)      |
| **Power**         | TeslaScythe Ambient Harvester (RF, thermal shift, piezoelectric)         |
| **Comms**         | Harmonic pulse transmission (non-detectable), fallback RF optional       |
| **Structure**     | Graphene-coated modular lattice, < 40‚ÄØkg total mass                      |
| **Propulsion**    | None. Uses field drift, orbital harmonics, and photon pressure           |
| **Stealth**       | No heat plume, no RF beacon, no glint. Radar cross-section minimized     |
| **Cost to Build** | ~$34,000 USD hardware, ~$400,000 launch (rideshare-ready)                |
| **Build Time**    | 3‚Äì6 months (standard fab, no classified tech required)                   |
