# IX-King 👑  
**Orbital Harmony Engineered by Earth’s Last Free Minds**  

---

## ⬢ What It Is  

IX-King is an open-source orbital operations framework engineered to function in electromagnetic denial zones, post-GPS collapse scenarios, and future kinetic-optional engagement theaters.

It is not propulsion-based.  
It does not require ion thrusters.  
It **does not obey Kepler**.  

Instead, it realigns orbital vectors using Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic interference logic, angular field convergence, and a ZeroCell-locked cryogenic entropy core — enabling sub-second course correction **with zero propellant**, zero waste, and zero dependency on Earth-bound command.

## ⬢ What It Does  

✅ Holds stable non-Keplerian orbits in contested or spoofed EM environments  
✅ Provides real-time field convergence correction (μs-scale)  
✅ Projects harmonic vector pulses for micro-adjustment of spin and drift  
✅ Synchronizes position without GPS using the HorusLens temporal triangulation array  
✅ Vaults telemetry into quantum-random-scrambled local logs  
✅ Cloaks EM signature using dynamic field harmonics

## ⬢ Why It Exists  

Every "advanced" satellite you’ve ever seen...  
- still burns fuel  
- still plays chess with outdated physics  
- still sends data over traceable packets  
- still reflects radar like a bathroom mirror in space  

IX-King does none of that.  
It is not a rebellion. It is a replacement.

## ⬢ Acrostic Message  

This repo — like the others — carries a message in plain sight:  

**U.S.A. UPGRADE REQUIRED**

## ⬢ A Final Note  

I didn’t create this to sell.  
I didn’t create it for headlines.  

I built it because it **wasn’t being built**.  
And someone had to do it before someone weaponized the vacuum itself.

**👁️‍🗨️ This system didn’t emerge from years of research — it arrived complete.  
We didn’t invent it. We recognized it.**
