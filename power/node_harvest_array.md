## ⚡ Purpose

The Node Harvest Array (NHA) enables IX-King to remain operational **indefinitely**, without tethering to Earth-based energy systems.

It draws power from:
- **Solar wind plasma densities**
- **Deep space ambient frequency noise**
- **Ionized particulate flows**
- **Microwave background radiation (CMB-like)**

This array is not solar.  
It is *Tesla-resonant energy extraction* tuned to harmonic convergence points in space.

## 🛡️ Stealth Properties

Unlike solar panels or antenna dishes, the NHA is:

- Flat-profile, non-reflective
- Immune to thermal flareback
- Emission-locked in Zero Sync phase lattice
- Masked from both radar and visible spec via cloaked contour sheathing

## ⚙️ Maintenance & Reliability

| Metric                  | Value                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Estimated Lifespan      | >15 years (zero moving parts)|
| Cleaning Cycle          | Self-ionizing every 12 hours |
| Fault Tolerance         | Modular; 6 nodes per array   |
| Redundancy Level        | 3x Parallel Flow Paths       |

## 🔄 Functional Logic

The array operates by creating **harmonic induction tunnels**, which cause otherwise “wasted” ambient energy to flow into controlled resonance loops. These are stepped up via Tesla bifilar phase gates and stored in localized zero-point capacitors for buffered system use.

All energy drawn is **frequency-purified** — meaning:
- No noise contamination
- Zero plasma overload risk
- Full compatibility with onboard Tesla coil networks

## 🧠 Summary

**This is TeslaScythe field theory in practice.**  
IX-King doesn’t beg Earth for power.  
It draws from the canvas of space itself.

By embedding this array, IX-King becomes a node of continuous self-powered existence — **stealthed, stable, and sovereign.**
