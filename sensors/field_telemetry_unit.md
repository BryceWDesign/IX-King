## 🎯 Objective

The Field Telemetry Unit (FTU) continuously samples **ambient field variations** and **convergence gradients** around IX-King using a Tesla-compatible sensor mesh.  
Its goals:

- Detect positional drift vs expected orbital harmonic
- Sample ambient electromagnetic noise (space EM density mapping)
- Identify distortions caused by cloaked, EM-active, or high-charge bodies (aka stealth interceptors, ASATs)
- Feed ambient data to the CryoCore sync loop and Comms burst logic

## 🧠 Sensor Architecture

| Module Name      | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| TeslaCap Grid    | 6× radial capacitive field sensors, isolated     |
| DriftSync Node   | Pulse-synchronized phase comparator              |
| FluxTap Core     | Passive harmonic detector (non-resonant)         |
| ROM Telemetry IC | Stores 90s sliding window of raw field data      |
| ShadowVector CPU | Estimates shadow mass fields via null-return     |

## 📍 Position Verification Logic

The FTU **never emits**. Instead:

- TeslaCap Grid senses ambient voltage differential across chassis edges  
- DriftSync Node compares internal 3-6-9 field vs expected orbital phase  
- If deviation >2.6ms for 3+ consecutive cycles → triggers alert to CryoCore

Estimates position error ±500m without GPS.

## 🌌 Ambient Energy Profiling

Every 12 seconds:

- FTU runs ambient scan on 3 harmonics: 3.69 kHz, 6.66 kHz, 9.99 kHz  
- Detects resonance coupling level per axis  
- Stores result as "ambient harvest potential" vector for `/power/ambient_harvest_array.md`

Each vector has:
- Axial orientation (pitch/yaw/roll)
- Strength index (0–100)
- Suggested timing offset for max capacitor pull

## ⚠ Anomaly Detection

**FluxTap Core** passively resonates with high-gradient external fields. When a fast shift is detected:

| Type           | Signature                | Action Triggered                    |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Charged body   | 12–25kHz harmonic noise  | Node focus shift, comms burst prep |
| Stealth field  | Negative gradient slope  | CryoCore pulse beacon + log        |
| EMP risk       | Broad null-field echo    | Immediate phase-lock fallback      |

## 🔐 Security & Isolation

All FTU components:
- Fully chassis-isolated, non-powered except during pulse sample window  
- Shielded in Faraday-layered microframe  
- Cross-checks timing via `/field/harmonic_sync.md` pulse data  

---

## 🔧 Output

Output is always internal and sync-loop fed:
- No wireless, no RF, no logging outside CryoCore buffer  
- Average data size: 512 bytes per 30 seconds  
- Stored cyclically, oldest data overwritten every 15 mins

Logged formats:
- `drift_trace.bin` → phase offset over time  
- `ambient_vector.log` → capacitor tuning aid  
- `threat_signature.log` → if anomaly detected

---

## 🧊 Integration Notes

FTU links directly to:
- `/core/cryocore_mount.md` — sync correction vectors  
- `/comms/pulse_modulator.md` — to trigger encoded whisper when anomaly found  
- `/power/ambient_harvest_array.md` — to optimize capacitor harvest timing  

No additional wiring required beyond TeslaCap ring — system uses **existing structural field flow** as its conduit.

## 🌀 Summary

IX-King doesn’t need radar.  
It doesn’t need lidar.  
It listens — to everything.  
Silently. Constantly.  
Through the field itself.
