## 🧿 Overview

The **Deep Optic Matrix (DOM)** is IX-King’s primary sensory organ. It fuses:
- High-dynamic-range optical imaging (VIS/NIR)
- Harmonic field wavefront detection (3-6-9 resonance)
- Mid-to-far infrared spectrum vision (thermal overlays)
- EM spectral echo sensing (pulse analysis / stealth detection)

This array allows IX-King to:
- Visually map terrain, space debris, and infrastructure  
- Detect gravitational lensing and exotic mass signatures  
- Lock onto resonance-coded signals from beam transmitters  
- Identify cloaked objects via harmonic drag or negative echo

## 📡 Uplink Compatibility

- Native handshake with IX-King’s harmonic transmitter  
- Beam-tracked resonance uplink mode auto-locks when returning coded pulse  
- Supports encrypted beam-informational handshake via 3-6-9 keyed optic flicker

## 🔐 Stealth Adaptation Mode

- Low-thermal passive imaging mode consumes <0.1 W  
- Harmonic field-only scan mode renders system visually inactive  
- Phase cloaking enabled via zero-flare dielectric lenses with anti-radar harmonics

## 💡 Summary

The Deep Optic Matrix transforms IX-King from a passive satellite to a **real-time, field-aware scout node**.

With Tesla-coded optics, graphene lens matrices, and harmonic imaging overlays, this sensor is designed for:
- Total domain awareness  
- Long-range non-interference monitoring  
- Informed harmonic command relays from deep space  
- Target acquisition without kinetic locks

IX-King sees what others don’t — and *knows* what others miss.
